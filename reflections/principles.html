    <li>People are either CPUs or GPUs, but not both.</li>
    <li>We all have user manuals that dictate how we operate. You can't change your own (try as you might), but you can discover/engineer workarounds to avoid behaviors you don't want to engage in. The best part about life is getting to intimately read your own user manual and sharing it with others. Many don't finish reading; others only make it halfway; some never even open the book.</li>
    <li>You are either an employee or an owner.</li>
    <li>Restraint is only learned through a sense of ownership.</li>
    <li>Money is only good for making memories.</li>
    <li>The best long-term strategy in life is to make frequent karmic deposits in the universe.</li>
    <li>Ignorance of subjectivity to cognitive biases is the primary reason for incorrect judgment by high performers.</li>
